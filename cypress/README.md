# Cypress Tests

This directory contains integration tests written with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

To run the tests locally, you must first have an instance of the API and web application up and running, with at least 11 notes in the database. Then you can run the tests with the Cypress UI or in headless mode:

```bash
npm run cy:open # ui mode
npm run cy:run # headless mode
```
